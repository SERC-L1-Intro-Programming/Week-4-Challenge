## Challenge Exercise 1 - Comma Code

Say you have a list value like this:

    spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']

In `commacode.py` file, write a function called `list_to_grammar()`. This function will take a list value as an input argument and return a string with all the list items separated by a comma and a space, except before the last item, which will have an _and_ inserted instead. For example, passing the previous spam list to the function would return 'apples, bananas, tofu and cats'. 

Your function should be able to work with any list value passed to it, including empty lists [].
